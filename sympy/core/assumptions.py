class AssumeMixin(object):
    """ Define default assumption methods.

    AssumeMeths should be used to derive Basic class only.

    All symbolic objects have assumption attributes that can be accessed via
    .is_<assumption name> attribute.

    Assumptions determine certain properties of symbolic objects. Assumptions
    can have 3 possible values: True, False, None.  None is returned when it is
    impossible to say something about the property. For example, a Symbol is
    not know beforehand to be positive.

    By default, all symbolic values are in the largest set in the given context
    without specifying the property. For example, a symbol that has a property
    being integer, is also real, complex, etc.

    Here follows a list of possible assumption names:

        - commutative   - object commutes with any other object with
                          respect to multiplication operation.
        - real          - object can have only values from the set
                          of real numbers
        - integer       - object can have only values from the set
                          of integers
        - bounded       - object absolute value is bounded
        - positive      - object can have only positive values
        - negative      - object can have only negative values
        - nonpositive      - object can have only nonpositive values
        - nonnegative      - object can have only nonnegative values
        - comparable    - object.evalf() returns Number object.
        - irrational    - object value cannot be represented exactly by Rational
        - unbounded     - object value is arbitrarily large
        - infinitesimal - object value is infinitesimal


    Examples rules:

      positive=T            ->  nonpositive=F, real=T
      real=T & positive=F   ->  nonpositive=T

      unbounded=F|T         ->  bounded=not unbounded   XXX ok?
      irrational=T          ->  real=T


    Implementation note: assumption values are stored in
    ._assumption dictionary or are returned by getter methods (with
    property decorators) or are attributes of objects/classes.

    Examples
    ========

        - True, when we are sure about a property. For example, when we are
        working only with real numbers:
        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> Symbol('x', real = True)
        x

        - False

        - None (if you don't know if the property is True or false)

           NOTE: You should not use this directly -- see make__get_assumption
                 instead

           This function is called when a request is made to see what a fact
           value is.

           If we are here, it means that the asked-for fact is not known, and
           we should try to find a way to find its value.

           For this we use several techniques:

           1. _eval_is_<fact>
           ------------------

           first fact-evaluation function is tried,  for example
           _eval_is_integer


           2. relations
           ------------

           if the first step did not succeeded (no such function, or its return
           is None) then we try related facts. For example

                       means
             rational   -->   integer

           another example is joined rule:

             integer & !odd  --> even

           so in the latter case if we are looking at what 'even' value is,
           'integer' and 'odd' facts will be asked.


           3. evalf() for comparable
           -------------------------

           as a last resort for comparable objects we get their numerical value
           -- this helps to determine facts like 'positive' and 'negative'



           In all cases when we settle on some fact value, it is given to
           _learn_new_facts to deduce all its implications, and also the result
           is cached in ._assumptions for later quick access.
