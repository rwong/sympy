"""This is rule-based deduction system for SymPy

The whole thing is split into two parts

 - rules compilation and preparation of tables
 - runtime inference

For rule-based inference engines, the classical work is RETE algorithm [1],
[2] Although we are not implementing it in full (or even significantly)
it's still still worth a read to understand the underlying ideas.

In short, every rule in a system of rules is one of two forms:

 - atom                     -> ...      (alpha rule)
 - And(atom1, atom2, ...)   -> ...      (beta rule)


The major complexity is in efficient beta-rules processing and usually for an
expert system a lot of effort goes into code that operates on beta-rules.


Here we take minimalistic approach to get something usable first.

 - (preparation)    of alpha- and beta- networks, everything except
 - (runtime)        FactRules.deduce_all_facts
