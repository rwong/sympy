        everything that can be integrated. If you find something, that it
        doesn't, it is easy to implement it.

        (1) Simple heuristics (based on pattern matching and integral table):

         - most frequently used functions (e.g. polynomials)
         - functions non-integrable by any of the following algorithms (e.g.
           exp(-x**2))

        (2) Integration of rational functions:

         (a) using apart() - apart() is full partial fraction decomposition
         procedure based on Bronstein-Salvy algorithm. It gives formal
         decomposition with no polynomial factorization at all (so it's fast
         and gives the most general results). However it needs much better
         implementation of RootsOf class (if fact any implementation).
         (b) using Trager's algorithm - possibly faster than (a) but needs
         implementation :)

        (3) Whichever implementation of pmInt (Mateusz, Kirill's or a
        combination of both).

          - this way we can handle efficiently huge class of elementary and
            special functions

        (4) Recursive Risch algorithm as described in Bronstein's integration
        tutorial.

          - this way we can handle those integrable functions for which (3)
            fails

        (5) Powerful heuristics based mostly on user defined rules.

        Substitute old with new in the integrand and the limits, but don't
        change anything that is (or corresponds to) a variable of integration.

        The normal substitution semantics -- traversing all arguments looking
        for matching patterns -- should not be applied to the Integrals since
        changing the integration variables should also entail a change in the
        integration limits (which should be done with the transform method). So
        this method just makes changes in the integrand and the limits.

        Not all instances of a given variable are conceptually the same: the
        first argument of the limit tuple and any corresponding variable in
        the integrand are dummy variables while every other symbol is a symbol
        that will be unchanged when the integral is evaluated. For example, in

            Integral(x + a, (a, a, b))

        the dummy variables are shown below with angle-brackets around them and
        will not be changed by this function:

            Integral(x + <a>, (<a>, a, b))

        If you want to change the lower limit to 1 there is no reason to
        prohibit this since it is not conceptually related to the integration
        variable, <a>. Nor is there reason to disallow changing the b to 1.

        If a second limit were added, however, as in:

            Integral(x + a, (a, a, b), (b, 1, 2))

        the dummy variables become:

            Integral(x + <a>, (<a>, a, <b>), (<b>, a, b))

        Note that the `b` of the first limit is now a dummy variable since `b` is a
        dummy variable in the second limit.

        Summary: no variable of the integrand or limit can be the target of
        substitution if it appears as a variable of integration in a limit
        positioned to the right of it.

        **method = midpoint**:

        Uses the n-order midpoint rule to evaluate the integral.

        Midpoint rule uses rectangles approximation for the given area (e.g.
        definite integral) of the function with heights equal to the point on
        the curve exactly in the middle of each interval (thus midpoint
        method). See [1] for more information.

        **method=left**:

        Uses the n-order rectangle rule to evaluate the integral, at each
        interval the function value is taken at the left hand side of the
        interval.

def integrate(*args, **kwargs):
    """integrate(f, var, ...)

       Compute definite or indefinite integral of one or more variables
       using Risch-Norman algorithm and table lookup. This procedure is
       able to handle elementary algebraic and transcendental functions
       and also a huge class of special functions, including Airy,
       Bessel, Whittaker and Lambert.

       var can be:

       - a symbol                   -- indefinite integration
       - a tuple (symbol, a, b)     -- definite integration

       Several variables can be specified, in which case the result is multiple
       integration.

       Also, if no var is specified at all, then the full anti-derivative of f is
       returned. This is equivalent to integrating f over all its variables.

       Definite improper integrals often entail delicate convergence conditions.
       Pass conds='piecewise', 'separate' or 'none' to have these returned,
       respectively, as a Piecewise function, as a separate result (i.e. result
       will be a tuple), or not at all (default is 'piecewise').

       **Strategy**

       SymPy uses various approaches to integration. One method is to find
       an antiderivative for the integrand, and then use the fundamental theorem
       of calculus. Various functions are implemented to integrate polynomial,
       rational and trigonometric functions, and integrands containing DiracDelta
       terms. There is also a (very successful, albeit somewhat slow) general
       implementation of the heuristic risch algorithm.
       See the docstring of Integral._eval_integral() for more details on computing
       the antiderivative using algebraic methods.

       Another family of strategies comes from re-writing the integrand in
       terms of so-called Meijer G-functions. Indefinite integrals of a single
       G-function can always be computed, and the definite integral of a
       product of two G-functions can be computed from zero to infinity.
       Various strategies are implemented to rewrite integrands as
       G-functions, and use this information to compute integrals (see the
       ``meijerint`` module).

       In general, the algebraic methods work best for computing
       antiderivatives of (possibly complicated) combinations of elementary
       functions. The G-function methods work best for computing definite
       integrals from zero to infinity of moderately complicated combinations
       of special functions, or indefinite integrals of very simple
       combinations of special functions.

       The strategy employed by the integration code is as follows:

       - If computing a definite integral, and both limits are real,
         and at least one limit is +- oo, try the G-function method of
         definite integration first.

       - Try to find an antiderivative, using all available methods, ordered
         by performance (that is try fastest method first, slowest last;
         in particular polynomial integration is tried first, meijer g-functions
         second to last, and heuristic risch last).

       - If still not successful, try G-functions irrespective of the limits.

       The option meijerg=True, False, None can be used to, respectively:
       always use G-function methods and no others, never use G-function methods,
       or use all available methods (in order as described above). It defailts
       to None.
